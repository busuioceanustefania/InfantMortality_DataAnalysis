# InfantMortality_DataAnalysis

The project involves developing software for data analysis focused on infant mortality in European countries, utilizing data from EUROSTAT for 2020. It explores socio-economic dynamics through Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA), and Cluster Analysis to identify patterns, correlations, and insights that could inform policymaking and societal interventions. The analysis covers various factors including health, demographics, education, poverty, lifestyle, infrastructure, and environmental sustainability, aiming to provide a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing infant mortality across Europe.
